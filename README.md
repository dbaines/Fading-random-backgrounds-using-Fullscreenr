Fading random backgrounds using Fullscreenr
==========================================

A cool little script that randomly fades between a set of fullscreen(r) backgrounds.
I've included a bunch of configurables at the top of the script.js file. The example here is running debug mode which pollutes the console log. This can be turned off.
